# seed-root
A template repository for starting new repositories and seeding them with common files and structure.

## structure
The root folder contains common subfolders /source and /test. Each contains its own Directory.Build.props file. /source is intended for code source project folders, while /test is intended for automated tests that correspond to each /source subfolder.
